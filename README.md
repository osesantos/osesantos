I'm a SW Engineer by day and a bug bounty hunter by night. 
Motivated to identify vulnerabilities, develop robust solutions, and collaborate with cross-functional teams.

🔭 I’m currently working as a full-stack engineer with Typescript, Javascript, React, and C#.
🌱 I’m on a journey to obtain the [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Infosec projects/tools, go, rust, and Linux projects.
📫 Feel free to reach out.
😄 I’m happy to learn and discuss any tech and cybersecurity-related topic.
⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding or hunting bugs, you'll find me hiking and kitesurfing – I love embracing the great outdoors! ⛰🏄‍.
